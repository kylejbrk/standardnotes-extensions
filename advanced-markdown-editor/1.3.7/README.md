# Advanced Markdown Editor

This editor is based on [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor), which is a fork of the now unmaintained [SimpleMDE](https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor).

For issues related to core functionality, we suggest creating an issue on the [core repo](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor) instead. For issues specifically related to how this editor integrates with Standard Notes, please feel free to create an issue in this repo.
